# Data-Analysis-of-21-Supermarkets-in-Baku-City
This information visualization project delves into the exploration and analysis of a robust dataset capturing supermarket transactions in Baku, Azerbaijan, throughout the year 2019. The dataset encompasses a wealth of information, including details on 438,826 products purchased by a diverse customer base of approximately 80,000 individuals. Transactions were conducted across 21 branches, offering insights into the geographical and operational nuances of the supermarkets during the specified year.
The project employs a variety of visualization techniques to elucidate patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset. Utilizing tools such as bar plots, count plots, line plots, and area plots, the project visually represents key aspects of the supermarket transactions. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is conducted to distill the dataset's multidimensional information into a more manageable form, aiding in the identification of underlying structures and relationships.
The preprocessing steps undertaken before analysis are integral to the project's reliability. Null values are removed, ensuring data completeness, while duplicate rows and the 'ID' column are eliminated to enhance dataset integrity. Furthermore, a transition from Azerbaijani to English is facilitated by translating column names and values using the 'googleTranslator' library, fostering a more universally accessible and interpretable dataset.
This project not only sheds light on the sheer scale of supermarket transactions in Baku but also offers a visual narrative that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior, product distribution, and the operational landscape of the supermarkets. The combination of exploratory data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing techniques contributes to a robust and insightful examination of the supermarket dataset, providing a foundation for future studies and decision-making processes within the retail industry.
